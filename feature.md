Got it! Let's break down the **roadmap** into clear phases and steps, starting from the **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** to the **full feature set**. I'll keep the design extensible so that new features can be easily added or removed later on.

## **Roadmap for Auto LGTM - AI Code Reviewer**

### **Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**

The MVP will focus on getting the core functionalities up and running with a simple, easy-to-extend architecture.

#### Key Features for MVP:

1. **PR Fetching & Diff Extraction**

   * Integrate with GitHub's API to fetch PRs and extract diffs. - ✅ Done 

2. **Basic LLM Integration**

   * Set up a basic integration with a language model (OpenAI, for example) to provide code suggestions. - ✅ Done

3. **Automated Code Review Comments**

   * Post LLM-generated comments back to GitHub PRs (for bugs, suggestions, etc.). - ✅ Done

4. **GitHub Integration for Auto Comments**

   * Trigger review comments when a PR is opened or updated.

5. **Basic Configuration**

   * Simple config to control which files to analyze (Python only, for example).

#### **LLD for MVP:**

* **Services:**

  * **GitHubService** – Handles fetching PRs, posting comments, and interacting with GitHub.
  * **ReviewService** – Handles analyzing the diff and generating review comments via LLM.

* **Data Flow:**

  1. **GitHubService** fetches the PR diff.
  2. Pass the diff to **ReviewService**.
  3. **ReviewService** analyzes the code, generates review comments.
  4. **GitHubService** posts the comments on the PR.

* **Code Extensibility Consideration:**

  * The system should allow easy integration of additional GitHub services, LLM models, or configuration options without altering the core logic.

---

### **Phase 2: Low-Level Design (LLD) & Architecture**

Now, we will flesh out the **low-level design (LLD)**, considering modularity, easy code updates, and maintainability.

#### Core LLD Components:

1. **GitHubService**

   * Handles GitHub API calls.
   * Fetch PR diff, post review comments, fetch PR context.
2. **LLMService**

   * Interfaces with the LLM (OpenAI, etc.).
   * Takes code diff as input and generates review suggestions.
3. **ConfigManager**

   * Manages configuration, such as which file types to review, or whether auto-approving PRs is allowed.
4. **Logger**

   * Centralized logging to track actions like fetching PRs, generating reviews, etc.
5. **ReviewData**

   * Holds review data (comments, suggestions) and ensures easy extension for future data storage.

---

### **Phase 3: Adding New Features**

Once the MVP and LLD are ready, we’ll implement additional features step-by-step. Each new feature will be designed to be modular and extendable, so we can easily add or remove them.

#### Step 1: **Enhanced LLM Review**

* Integrate multiple models (OpenAI, Claude, etc.).
* Add the ability to toggle between models based on severity, file type, etc.

#### Step 2: **Review Metrics & History**

* Track metrics like review time, number of suggestions, etc.
* Implement a simple database or local file storage to store review history.

#### Step 3: **Advanced Configuration**

* Provide more granular config options (severity levels, developer feedback handling).
* Allow multiple rulesets for different repositories or teams.

#### Step 4: **Security & Privacy (Secrets Handling)**

* Implement functionality to check and remove sensitive data (e.g., API keys) from PR diffs before sending them to LLM.

#### Step 5: **CLI Interface for Local Reviews**

* Allow developers to run the reviewer locally via CLI before pushing changes to GitHub.

#### Step 6: **Web Dashboard (Optional)**

* Build a simple dashboard to view PR review insights, feedback, and history.

---

### **Phase 4: Maintenance & Future Enhancements**

At this stage, your Auto LGTM will be fully functional, and you can focus on **maintaining** and **upgrading**:

1. **Add new models** to improve the review quality or cover new programming languages.
2. **Improve LLM prompts** for better results.
3. **Expand GitHub integration** (e.g., adding support for GitLab, Bitbucket).
4. **Enhance security features**, such as masking secrets or scanning for security vulnerabilities in PRs.

---

### **Extensibility in Code Design:**

1. **Service-based architecture**:

   * Services like **GitHubService**, **LLMService**, and **ReviewService** should have clear responsibilities and interfaces.
   * Each service can be independently replaced or extended without modifying the core logic.

2. **Config-driven logic**:

   * The **ConfigManager** can be modified to easily add new configuration options without changing the review process.
   * Example: Adding new models, rulesets, or severity thresholds could be done by just modifying the config.

3. **Interface-based communication**:

   * Define clear interfaces for communication between the services, so the code is agnostic to specific GitHub or LLM implementations.

### **Summary Roadmap:**

1. **MVP**: Simple PR diff fetching, basic LLM integration, GitHub comment posting.
2. **LLD**: Set up the architecture with modular services (GitHubService, ReviewService, etc.).
3. **Features**: Gradually add features like enhanced LLM review, review metrics, security, CLI, and dashboard.
4. **Extensibility**: Keep all services separate and interface-driven, so future additions/removals are simple.

Would you like to dive deeper into any of these phases or start on a specific component like **GitHub integration** or **LLM service setup**?
